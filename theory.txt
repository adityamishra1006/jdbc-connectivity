JDBC : JDBC stands for Java Data Base Connectivity

We will be having a database in our system to store data.
If we have database and we have a java code. 


We have to connect the frontend application with the backend database, for that we require a connectivity. And for that connectivity we use JDBC.
JDBC is a Java API that allows Java programs to access and manipulate data stored in relational databases.
JDBC is a standard API for connecting to relational databases from Java programs.


We have to follow some steps to connect java application to database.
1. Import the package
    We will use this package (java.sql.*)
2. Load and register the driver
    a. Load the driver : for MySQL the driver is (com.mysql.jdbc.Driver)
            We have to download a .jar file of MySQL Connector
    b. Register the driver : class forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver)
3. Establish the connection
    We have to instantiate an interface called "Connection".
4. Create a statement
    a. Normal statement
    b. Collable statement
5. Execute the query
6. Process results
7. Close the connection 


how to write in code?

import java.sql.*;

main(){
    class forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver);
    Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("URL", "UserName", "Password");
    Statement st = con.createStatement();
    ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM table_name");
    while(rs.next()){
        System.out.println(rs.getInt(1) +" "+rs.getString(2));
    }
    st.close();
    con.close();
}
